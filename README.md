### Installation
For now the easiest and most reliable way to install this is to build it from source.
To do that, please see the Getting started section below.

If you're feeling adventurous, you can download the latest deb release and give that a try, but there are known issues with it.
**_NOTE:_** The deb package that is made as part of the release _might not_ working as intended. 
I'm working on fixing this. And if you know how to package for Debian and Ubuntu, feel free to help out. See https://github.com/SneWs/tail-tray/issues/12 for details

### Prerequisites
* Tailscale installed and running - https://tailscale.com 
* davfs2 installed and configured (If you plan on using Tail drives or accessing Tail drives. Tail Tray also helps you to automatically configure this) - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Davfs2


### Supported architectures
* x86_64
* ARM64
* Any other architecture that QT 6 supports and where you can compile this project and where Tailscale runs

### Getting started
1. Install the following dependencies
   * Git, QT 6, cmake and a c++ compiler, for example:
      * On Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros
         ```bash
         sudo apt install git qt6-tools-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools g++ clang cmake davfs2
         ```
     * On Fedora
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install -y git g++ clang cmake qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qttools-devel qt6-qtbase-private-devel davfs2

      * On Arch Linux
         ```bash
         sudo pacman -S git clang cmake qt6-base qt6-tools
         ```
        ```bash 
        # For davfs2 we need to use the AUR
        yay -S davfs2
        ```
      * If you are running Gnome and not using Ubuntu, make sure to install AppIndicator so you can see your tray icons. See https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/
